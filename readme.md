## Creating and Switching Branches

### Creating a New Branch

To create a new branch for a feature or bugfix, use the following command:

```bash
git branch feature/my-new-feature
```

This command creates a new branch named `feature/my-new-feature` that diverges from the current branch (usually `master` or `main`).

### Switching Branches

To switch to the newly created branch and start working on it, use:

```bash
git checkout feature/my-new-feature
```

Now, you are on the `feature/my-new-feature` branch, and any changes you make will be committed to this branch.
